# üè° Find Residences RPA Project

## üìñ Project Overview
The **Find Residences** project is an RPA (Robotic Process Automation) solution developed with **UiPath Studio 2025.0.157**. This automation assists users in finding available residences (apartments, houses, etc.) for sale or rent across multiple websites. The process is triggered upon receiving a payment invoice and an email with search details.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **User Email Request**
   - Users send an email to **findapartaments99@outlook.com**.
   - The email should include:
     - **Search criteria**: desired location, price range, property type, etc.
     - **PDF attachment**: A payment invoice for the search service.

2. **Invoice Verification**
   - The robot monitors incoming emails.
   - For each email, it extracts and validates the attached payment invoice.
   - If the invoice is invalid, the robot replies to the user, indicating the error.

3. **Residence Search**
   - Upon successful invoice validation, the robot uses the provided search criteria to explore various real estate websites.
   - Filters applied include location, price range, number of rooms, and other preferences.

4. **Results Compilation**
   - The bot compiles the found listings into an Excel file.
   - The file includes essential information such as property address, price, contact details, and website link.

5. **Response Email**
   - The robot sends an email back to the user with the results attached.
